	<h2>About Dalí</h2>
</div>
<div> 
	
	<p>Salvador Domenec Felip Jacint Dalí Domenech (May 11, 1904 - January 23, 1989) was a Spanish painter. He is preferably known for his surrealist paintings - and sculptures.</p>
	<blockquote>"A true painter is one who can paint extraordinary scenes in the middle of an empty desert. A true painter is one who can patiently paint a pear in the midst of the tumults of history." Salvador Dalí.</blockquote>
	<p>
	In 1924 wrote André Breton's first Surrealist manifesto, Manifest you Surrealism. The manifesto states the French surrealisters target firm.</p> <p>According to it came much art from the subconscious and the dreaming self. In 1929 Dalí really entered in the surrealist group. Among the group's members are: Max Ernst, André Breton, Paul Éluard and Man Ray. </p>

	<h2>The Smiling Venus</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Along with the sensual (or clearly sexual) features, we have the smiling face of the girl who "offers herself", just as in the foreground some food delicacies (wine, fruit, etc.) are "offering themselves" in consonance with the landscape:</p> 
<blockquote>a cove in which two lateen-sail boats are cutting through the water with their corresponding reflections. </blockquote>
<p>
The painting - oil on cardboard - which uses for the marine view in the background a pointillist technique often to be found in Dalí's work over the course of 1921 and 1922, was probably conceived as an ironic version of the feminine archetypes of Catalan Noucentisme.

	<h2>Soft Self-Portrait with Grilled Bacon</h2>
</div>
<div> 
	<p>A spectre full of irony, where an amorphous, soft face appears, supported by crutches, which Dalí considered his self-portrait, with a pedestal that bears the inscription of the title of the work and, above, a slice of fried bacon, a symbol of organic matter and of the everyday nature of his breakfasts in New York’s Saint Regis Hotel.</p>
	<blockquote>Dalí always remembered the piece of flayed skin with which Michelangelo represented himself in the Sistine chapel in the Vatican and argued the most consistent thing of our representation is not the spirit or the vitality, but the skin.

	<h2>Galarina</h2> 
</div>
<div>
	<p>In the catalogue for the exhibition in the Bignou Gallery in New York, held from the 20th of November to the 29th of December 1945, Dalí stated:</p> 
	<blockquote>
	 & “Begun in 1944, this work was completed in six months, working three hours a day. I called it Galarina because Gala is to me what La Fornarina was to Raphael. And, without any premeditation, here again we have…the bread! A rigorous and keen-eyed analysis will show that Gala’s crossed arms are like the interwoven wicker of the breadbasket, and her breast, the crust of bread. ,,,, ”</blockquote>
